# BusinessCard
BusinessCard is an app that takes the text of a business card generated by an OCR

The method BusinessCardParser.getContactInfo(cardText) takes the generated text and returns a ContactInfo object

ContactInfo has the getters getName(), getPhoneNumber() and getEmailAddress() to return the name, phone number and email address from the business card.

## Implementation Details

BusinessCard is developed in Scala, so it's classes can be used by Java or other JVM languages.

Out of the box, BusinessCard can recognize common names and provides simple parsers for name, phone number, and email address.  This default implementation should parse most cards accuratly, but the interface permits the user to override the defaults if they have special parsing needs.

To override the default list of names, pass in a custom properties file by calling:
BusinessCard.loadProperties(nameOfPropertiesFile)
the custom property file must supply the property "businesscard.name.file" with a value of the custome names file.

To override the the default parsing of name, phone number, and email address, implement your own parsing functions with the signatures:

parseName(document : List[List[String]]) : String
parsePhoneNumber(document : List[List[String]]) : String
parseEmailAddress(document : List[List[String]]) : String

then call:
BusinessCard.getContactInfo(parseName, parsePhoneNumber, parseEmailAddress)(cardText)

The default email parser uses a regex found at stackoverflow.com/questions/8204680/java-regex-email#8204716
